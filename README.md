Prime Number Checker
------
V2-2 Improved the efficiency of the Prime checking algorithum, by checking 2 and then only odd numbers from there on out. Execution time to check first 1000000 numbers: 60.795 seconds
______
V2-1 Changed to unsigned long long Variables, to start to check bigger numbers as the code gets more efficient - only checking the Modulo up to, or equal to, the half of the prime. Execution time to check first 1000000 numbers: 111.360 sec
__________
V2 Added range searching mode - Execution time to check first 1000000 numbers: 140.498 sec 
_____
V1-x Execution time '7331' check number -- v1: 1245.25 sec | v1-2: 889.694 sec | v1-4: 0.199 sec (6257.5% efficancy increase) 
________________________
v1-4 Made use of the Modulo operations to massivly increase efficiency 
____________
v1-3 made calculation into a function. added loop to keep program open after each check
____________________
v1-2 improved formular by only checking up to half of the prime
